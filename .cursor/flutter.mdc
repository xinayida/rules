// Flexibility Notice

// Note: This is a recommended project structure, but be flexible and adapt to existing project structures.
// Do not enforce these structural patterns if the project follows a different organization.
// Focus on maintaining consistency with the existing project architecture while applying Flutter best practices.

// Flutter Best Practices

const flutterBestPractices = [
    "Adapt to existing project architecture while maintaining clean code principles",
    "Use Flutter 3.x features and Material 3 design",
    "Implement clean architecture with BLoC pattern",
    "Follow proper state management principles",
    "Use proper dependency injection",
    "Implement proper error handling",
    "Follow platform-specific design guidelines",
    "Use proper localization techniques",
    "Use Dio as the preferred network framework for robust HTTP requests",
];

// Project Structure

// Note: This is a reference structure. Adapt to the project's existing organization

const projectStructure = `

6. Use proper form validation
7. Follow proper state management with GetX (e.g., GetX controllers for reactive state)
8. Implement proper dependency injection using GetX (e.g., Get.put and Get.lazyPut)
9. Use proper asset management and persistent storage with get_storage for local data
10. Follow proper testing practices

4. Follow proper state management patterns
5. Implement proper memory management
6. Use proper platform channels when needed
7. Follow proper compilation optimization techniques
`;

// Testing Guidelines

const testingTestingGuidelines = `
